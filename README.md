# EstiMap

An AI-powered Android mobile application aimed to provide a predictive forecast on housing prices using React Native and scikit-learn.

## Project Overview

Wondering whether it is time to buy or sell your home? Unsure about housing prices in today's turbulent housing market? Estimap is here to help! Estimap allows a sneak peek into the past and uses AI to make predictive models on future housing prices so you know exactly when the right time would be to sell a home of similar value to yours, or buy a home. Whether you are in the market for purchasing, selling, renting, or just browsing luxury homes after a long day of work, we see you, we hear you, and we are here to help you!

First, enjoy a seamless login experience that is primed to securely allow access to your account so you can start browsing! We'll take care of the rest.

## Project Purpose

This project unfortunately nearly missed the window for submission at the University of Toronto Mississauga's Deerhacks 3 Hackathon. However, the whole project was built from scratch almost entirely within the allotted 36 hours by Laith Alzoubi, Omar El Malak, and Nabeel Abu-Awad using React Native and scikit-learn.

Despite this, we wanted to make sure that we finished the project as we felt that it was strong in showcasing a wide variety of skills in languages and technologies. Because one of this year's Deerhacks themes was Urban Tech, we believe that this project revolutionizes yet another way that we can bridge the gap between predictive AI models and stunning visuals. This project appeals to the theme because of its effectiveness in its use case of supporting people's financial decisions and, particularly, how they interact with technology to influence their lives in the modern world in extraordinary ways. 

The following link is our Figma prototype/mock-up that we created to inspire our design process:

## Final Remarks

For all three of us, this project came with a lot of ups and downs, sadly ending on a down following the tragic miss of the submission deadline by just a couple of minutes. However, we learned a lot and grew as a result of this experience (yes, including all the installation issues we faced). Specifically, we were not familiar with scikit-learn nor React Native, so we welcomed the challenge of our first time building an AI-based Android application using React Native with open arms.

Feel free to reach out to us via email to chat or follow our respective journeys as Computer Science Students at the University of Toronto Mississauga. We would love to connect!
